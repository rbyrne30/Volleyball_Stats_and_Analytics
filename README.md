# Volleyball_Stats_and_Analytics
A volleyball scouting tool

Keeps track of:
- hitting locations of each player for each position (ex. bic vs outside vs rightside) as well as outcomes (kills/errors/playable) 
- serving types and locations for each player
- setting tendencies for each rotation (including dumps)
- passing ratings for each player based on serve type
